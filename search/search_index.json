Sounding rocket under-flight calibration flights are carried out regularly over the SDO mission\u2019s duration to ensure the accuracy of EVE-collected data by measuring any changes to the EVE instrument in space. </p> <p>Please check the Launch Updates for the latest information on the Rocket EVE 36.389 launch.</p>"},{"location":"media/","title":"Media","text":""},{"location":"media/#check-out-what-nasa-has-to-say-about-the-eve-sounding-rocket-program","title":"Check out what NASA has to say about the EVE sounding rocket program","text":"<p>Watching the Sun 24/7 can be tough on a telescope \u2013 but NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory has a trusty sidekick to keep its data in shape! pic.twitter.com/W5Y7UnGMc6</p>\u2014 NASA Sun &amp; Space (@NASASun) May 1, 2023 <p>The Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) rocket carries a replica of an instrument aboard SDO.
