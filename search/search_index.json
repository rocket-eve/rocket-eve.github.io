Built and controlled by LASP, the EVE instrument measures solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance, or the energy from the Sun that heats most of Earth\u2019s thermosphere. Sounding rocket under-flight calibration flights are carried out regularly over the SDO mission\u2019s duration to ensure the accuracy of EVE-collected data by measuring any changes to the EVE instrument in space. </p> <p>Please check the Launch Updates for the latest information on the Rocket EVE 36.389 launch.</p>"}]}
